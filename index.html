						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p> Hi there, I'm Corbin (they/them), a third-year AGPM and Art double-major. I like SCUBA diving, cats, and creating worlds.
							The characters that go in them are very much a labor of love and are truly what I hope to continue doing for a career. I want
							to be a 3D artist and a concept artist when I enter the field of game design, and I would love to garner a following for my
							stories.
						</p>
						<p>I really have nothing else to say here, so have my favorite copypasta.</p>
						<p>
							man & girl go out to drive under moonlight. they stop at on at a side of road. he turn to his girl and say: 
							"baby, i love you very much" "what is it honey?" "our car is broken down. i think the engine is broken, ill walk 
							and get some more fuel." "ok. ill stay here and look after our stereo. there have been news report of steres being 
							stolen." "good idea. keep the doors locked no matter what. i love you sweaty"so the guy left to get full for the 
							car. after two hours the girl say "where is my baby, he was supposed to be back by now". then the girl here a 
							scratching sound and a voice say "LET ME IN"the girl doesn't do it and then after a while she goes to sleep. the 
							next morning she wakes up and finds her boyfriend still not there. she gets out to check and man door hand hook car door.
