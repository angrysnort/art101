			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Write psuedocode for two tasks: an everyday task and a simple game. Then, input the latter into an HTML file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problems were towards proper phrasing and making sure not to break the pseudocode down too much or make it too complex.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was pretty interesting and fun, and I've written pseudocode before in other classes, so I knew the gist of what we were doing.
						I feel that we put much more effort into this assignment than was necessary by using images and links to outside sources.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<center><p>Refer to diagram for appropriate terminology</p></center>
					<pre><code>
						//Ensure can of choice is unbreached (no weird dents, bulges, etc.)
							//If it does, discard it properly.
						//Ensure can of choice does not have a pop-tab
							//If can has a pop-tab, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Soda-Can">seek assistance elsewhere.</a>
						//Locate can opener
							//If you do not have a can opener, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Buy-on-Amazon">seek assistance elsewhere.</a>
						//Place can on table
						//Open can opener arms
						//Clamp can lid in between the cutting and notched wheels via closing the arms
						//While holding can opener arms shut with one hand, turn the turning knob with your other hand. 
							//The lid will start to slowly spread open as a result. You will smell the contents inside.
						//Once the can opener has made a full loop around the can, remove the lid with your hand(s) or utensil of choice.
						//Discard the lid if fully removed.
						//Enjoy the contents of your newly opened (with can opener) can!
