			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To make functions that take in user input and manipulate strings.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I originally had an issue with returning the functions on the JavaScript file, but realized that I could just return them through the console
						instead. I also had a hard time getting my functions in working order, because I didn't understand just how many of them I actually needed
						to get the program running properly. My partner helped me understand how to do everything, and then I got additional help from W3Schools
						and WesBot concerning Task X and printing the results properly.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this was an interesting assignment and while I was stressed about it at first, working with a partner helped me understand what
						I had to do. I thought it was fun troubleshooting for Task X as well.<br> <br>Concerning Task X, I decided I wanted to tackle sorting the
						string-to-array alphabetically while ignoring case, because the inconsistency was bothering me with the default sorting method. I looked
						into it myself at first, but didn't understand a lot of what was going on, so I asked WesBot/ChatGPT to help me out. It explained that it
						created a custom sorting method. It essentially checks what the array item WOULD be if toLowerCase was ACTUALLY run, without actually running
						it. When it does this, it can accurately sort the array items without changing the case, because it already recognized uppercase letters as
						what their lowercase letters would be.
					</p>
